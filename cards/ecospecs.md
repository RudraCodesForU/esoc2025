### ecoSPECS - AI for biotechnological cleanroom design

Build AI for design and equipment qualification of cleanrooms for biotech and pharmacological applications! Work with German engineering services provider ecoSPECS to fundamentally accelerate qualification processes in drug development, production, and monitoring worldwide.

#### project summary

Cleanroom design for biotech applications involves numerous "boilerplate steps". For instance, creating documentation in pre-specified format, particularly for identifying design and quality requirements within user specifications.

Although the design process is expert-driven, significant amount of formulaic editorial work is required. This makes the process well-suited for applying generative AI or automation approaches. AI could allow experts to focus on complex design tasks, rather than spending time on tedious documentation writing. This, in turn, would lead to significant acceleration and cost savings in the availability of biotechnological and pharmaceutical processes, systems, and equipment.

#### About ecoSPECS

[ecoSPECS](https://ecospecs.de/en/) is a German engineering service provider, specializing in services such as qualification, validation, consulting, training, and project planning across various industries, with a focus on pharmaceuticals, engineering, and food production.

#### Technical goals and datasets

ecoSPECS, a German engineering service provider, has compiled a unique dataset with documentation examples from real and stylized cleanroom and equipment designs. 

For an easy start, a simplified batch of requirement documents are provided. Examples come in pairs of user requirements (user requirement specification document - URSD) and functional specification documents (FSD). Both types of document combine formulaic structure with free content.

A useful AI system should be able to create a FSD from an URSD instance, with significantly reduced expert input, focusing on content rather than form (e.g., content prompts).

Experts to evaluate quality of machine generated FSD, in an overall or detail fashion,
will be readily accessible throughout the project period.

Stretch goals may include:

* building a performance measurement suite for quality of FSD,
* full process mapping with AI automation,
* retrieval augmented generation use cases,

all accompanied by unique data sets compiled by ecoSPECS.

Join this project for a unique opportunity to drive innovation with modern AI in biomedical research and manufacturing!
